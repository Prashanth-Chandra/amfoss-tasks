# In this Blog I am going to explain how I created my website

I used **HUGO** for this project and with some tutorials from youtube I learnt how to build a webiste.

1. First I downloaded HUGO in my laptop (but I forgot to add it in the `PATH` ,more on that later)
2. I watched a few tutorials in Youtube and then I tried to install my first template **Resume** from https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-resume/ but when I tried to run the server in the command prompt usig the command ``hugo server -D`` it was showing only the blank page on *localhost:1313*.
3. I tried so hard to figure it out but I was unable to do it so I even tried changing the templates but it yielded nor results. But then after reading the documentation 3 times I realised that I did not add the HUGO bin file to the `PATH` in the system variables. And when I used the command to run the server I got the sample page (By this time I switched to Coder template from https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-coder/)
4. Then from there everything went smoothly. I renamed all the variables and added my links to the buttons and a surprise link in one of the buttons.
5. I added blogs and wrote about myself in the website and then came the final challenge **UPLOADING THE WEBISTE** which I will be discussing in my next blog(or continue here).

## UPDATE

6.After watching a few youtube videos and trying their approach i found that I was making a mistake somewhere so i switched to netlify and tried and i got the website but the only thing that concerns me is the web site name https://elated-brattain-ebced6.netlify.app/

## UPDATE 2

7.I was actually able to change the website name to https://prashanth-chandra.netlify.app/ without paying for any subscription.

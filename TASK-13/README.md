# Task - 13

This task was easy I just had to know about the HC-SR04 which had a rande of 4m so I made the circuit(in tinkercard) and learnt a few commands from google related to general aurdino boards and hc-sr04 and applied it.My friend Samarth(VIT-Vellore CSE) tested this by physically connecting the components and teting it (on a small scale tho he took the scale as 1m=10cm)

# INTROSPECTION

**Why must we choose you?**

I'm fairly a newcomer in the field of programming and coding ('fairly' beacuse I had some programming using java in my 8th, 9th and 10th class).I am willing to work hard and enjoy taking part in various programs. I think amFoss is a great place to learn and get directly mentored by our seniors and teachers and make new friends.



**What is your plan for the next 6 months?**

My plan in next 6 months is that first I want to develope my skills in a particular language(mostly python or c++) and master it while working on a project. Then I will try to get good marks in the end-semester exams. Then I woulg like to work on some open source project.

**How would you contribute back to the club?**

By getting the good name to the club by excelling in various projects and competitions assigned to me. And in the future semisters I would liket to mentor few students(so that I can improve my communication skills while helping my junior)

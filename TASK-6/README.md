# Task - 6

# The recording is in ScreenRecorder.webm 

1. I saw few tutroials from youtube to install android studio and flutter
2. But I had an error something like `dev/kvm device:permission denied` so I tried all the debugging methods mentioed in google (but the problem was I forgot to restart my system) so on the next day it got installed
3. I used the introduction_screen plugin/library and created the UI (I used a little stackoverflow code for the text)
